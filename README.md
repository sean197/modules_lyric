# modules_lyricSearcher

This is a lyric searching app which was created using vanilla JavaScript.

The aim of the project was for a user to be able to search his/her favourite artists songs lyrics.

When the user searches a songaccompanied with the artist the lyrics for the song will be dislayed.

The project was used to consolidate my knowledge of fetch API, async/await, modules and promises.
